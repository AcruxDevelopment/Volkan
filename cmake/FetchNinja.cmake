#
# Downloads, verifies, and extracts the pinned ninja (see NinjaPin.cmake for
# the version/URL/hash) into TOOLCACHE_DIR. Run standalone, never included by
# the normal CMake configure -- ninja is needed as the generator itself
# (`cmake -G Ninja`), so it has to be resolved *before* configure runs, unlike
# Doxygen (see FetchDoxygen.cmake), which is only needed for a downstream
# custom target:
#
#   cmake -P cmake/FetchNinja.cmake
#
# This is what scripts/setup.sh / setup.bat call, and also what scripts/
# build.sh / build.bat call on demand if neither a pinned nor a system ninja
# is found (see the comment there). Safe to re-run any time; a no-op if the
# pinned version is already present.
# =============================================================================

# TOOLCACHE_DIR normally comes from Configuration.cmake, which isn't loaded
# in this standalone script-mode invocation -- match its default here. If
# you've overridden TOOLCACHE_DIR via -DTOOLCACHE_DIR=... at configure time,
# pass the same value here: cmake -DTOOLCACHE_DIR=... -P cmake/FetchNinja.cmake
