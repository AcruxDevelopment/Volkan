#
#   cmake -P cmake/FetchDoxygen.cmake
#
# This is what scripts/setup.sh / setup.bat call. It's deliberately not part
# of the main `cmake -S . -B out/build` configure -- see cmake/Documentation.cmake,
# which only ever LOOKS for the result of this script and never downloads
# anything itself, so a plain build never depends on Doxygen or on network
# access. Safe to re-run any time; a no-op if the pinned version is already
# present.
